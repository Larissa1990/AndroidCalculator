# AndroidCalculator
A calculator app runs on Android 11 and up. It is developed by JAVA.
This app provides simple and advanced mathematical functions, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and trigonometric, logarithmic, square root, etc.
Both basic calculations and scientific operations are processed by JavaCC, the most popular parser generator for use with Java applications.
For basic calculations, an extra method is integrated in the app that converts infix expression to postfix expression. 
The calculator.gif file in app/src/res shows how the app works.
